## Layouts
All Layout diagrams attached as dwg drawing files and pdf as well.

### 1. Civil Layout
The civil layout defines the structural design of the tower, detailing room arrangements, exits, and service areas. This foundational blueprint helps in planning the electrical layouts, ensuring proper spacing for wiring conduits and placements for distribution boards.

### 2. Fittings & Fixture Layout
This layout outlines the placement of essential electrical fixtures, including lights, fans, sockets, and switchboards. By detailing fixture locations, this plan ensures an organized and efficient layout that supports ease of use and maintenance.

### 3. Conduit Layout
The conduit layout maps out the pathways for electrical conduits throughout the building, ensuring an organized network for wiring. This layout helps minimize interference, reduces installation time, and supports future maintenance.

### 4. Conduit Layout for Light Load
Dedicated to circuits with lighter loads, this layout organizes the wiring for light fixtures, small appliances, and standard sockets. By keeping light loads separate, this design improves circuit efficiency and reduces risks of overload.

### 5. Conduit Layout for Heavy Load
Designed for high-power devices, this layout manages the conduits for heavy appliances and systems like HVAC, ensuring safe and efficient power distribution for energy-intensive devices.

### 6. Conduit Layout for TV & Internet
This specialized conduit layout handles the distribution of data and entertainment services, mapping out pathways for TV and internet connections. It ensures efficient data flow and reduces interference, enhancing signal reliability.

### 7. Switchboard Grouping & Connections Layout
This layout organizes switchboard placements and connections to streamline control of different circuits. Grouped based on load and proximity, this layout enhances user convenience and facilitates safer electrical management.

## Key Calculations
### Switchboard Calculations
Switchboard calculations are done for each grouping to ensure circuits can handle the designated loads, with each switchboard rated for specific amperage based on connected devices. For example, Switchboard 1 serves lights, a fan, and sockets with a total power load, calculated at 6A, and is protected by a 20A breaker for additional safety.

### Circuit Breaker Selection
Each circuit breaker is selected based on the current load, ensuring adequate protection without unnecessary power restrictions. Calculations for groupings allow the use of the optimal circuit breaker rating, with breakers chosen to prevent overload and support efficient power distribution.

### Sub-Distribution Board (SDB) Calculations
The sub-distribution board calculations determine total power demands for specific areas, ensuring the SDB can manage load safely. With a total power load calculated at 62.5kW, the SDB is equipped with a 170A circuit breaker, supporting all connected circuits and providing room for future adjustments.

### Main Distribution Board (MDB) Calculations
The MDB supports the full building load, which includes lighting, HVAC, water pumps, and elevators. Calculations estimate a load of 648.9kW, with a 1100A circuit breaker for safe and stable distribution. This ensures that all sub-distribution boards and main systems are powered adequately and safely.

## Essential Boards and Systems
### Sub-Distribution Board (SDB)
The SDBs distribute power within each floor, dividing the load for different rooms and essential systems. Grouped by usage, these boards ensure balanced power across the building, reducing the risk of circuit overload.

### Main Distribution Board (MDB)
The MDB is the primary power hub for the building, supplying electricity to all SDBs and major equipment. Its high amperage capacity ensures a stable supply, supporting essential functions and minimizing the risk of power outages.

### Emergency Fire Extinguishers
Strategically placed on each floor, fire extinguishers provide a quick response option in case of fire. Fire safety is enhanced with easily accessible fire alarms and extinguishers, improving occupant safety and compliance with fire safety regulations.

### Lightning Rod and Earthing System
The lightning rod protects the building from lightning strikes, directing electrical surges safely to the ground. This setup, along with an earthing system, prevents damage to electrical systems and ensures occupant safety during storms.

### Earthquake-Proof Design
The civil infrastructure is designed to withstand seismic activity, incorporating flexible materials and reinforcements to reduce structural stress. The building’s layout accommodates safety exits and structural support to minimize damage and protect occupants.
